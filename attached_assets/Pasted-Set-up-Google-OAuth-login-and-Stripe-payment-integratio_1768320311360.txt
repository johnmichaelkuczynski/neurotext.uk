Set up Google OAuth login and Stripe payment integration for this app.

DATABASE: The app uses Neon PostgreSQL. The connection string is already in the environment variables. Use the existing tables - do not create new ones.

EXISTING TABLES:
- users: id, username, password, email, created_at, last_active_at, google_id, display_name
- user_credits: id, user_id, provider, credits, last_updated

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ALREADY SET:
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- DATABASE_URL (Neon connection)

TASK 1 - GOOGLE OAUTH:
1. Install passport, passport-google-oauth20, express-session
2. Create route GET /auth/google that redirects to Google
3. Create route GET /auth/google/callback that handles Google's response
4. On successful login:
   - Check if user exists in users table by google_id
   - If not, create new user with google_id, email, display_name from Google profile
   - If yes, update last_active_at
   - Create session for user
5. Redirect to homepage after login

TASK 2 - HOMEPAGE:
1. If user is not logged in, show "Sign in with Google" button
2. If user is logged in, show:
   - Their display name
   - Their current credit balance (from user_credits table where user_id matches, sum the credits column)
   - "Buy Credits" button that links to: https://buy.stripe.com/cNibJ33W8ddG2Laa1sdZ600
   - "Logout" button

TASK 3 - STRIPE WEBHOOK:
1. Create route POST /webhook/stripe to receive Stripe payment confirmations
2. Use the stripe library to verify the webhook signature using STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
3. Parse the checkout.session.completed event
4. Get customer email from event.data.object.customer_details.email
5. Get quantity from event.data.object.amount_total / 100 (this gives dollars spent)
6. Calculate credits: quantity * 1000 (each $1 = 1000 credits)
7. Find user in users table by email
8. Insert new row in user_credits table with user_id, provider="stripe", credits=(calculated amount), last_updated=now()

TASK 4 - CREDIT DEDUCTION:
When the app makes an LLM API call, deduct credits from user_credits based on which model is used:
- DeepSeek: deduct 1 credit
- Grok: deduct 20 credits
- Perplexity: deduct 20 credits
- OpenAI: deduct 25 credits
- Claude Sonnet: deduct 35 credits

Before making any LLM call, check if user has enough credits. If not, show message "Insufficient credits" and prompt to buy more.

TASK 5 - LOGOUT:
1. Create route GET /logout that destroys session and redirects to homepage

CALLBACK URL FOR GOOGLE: https://neurotext.uk/auth/google/callback

Do not use any code from previous implementations. Build fresh.
